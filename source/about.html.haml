        Hello! I'm Jen
        %a{:href => "#", :title => "(ar-eh-vah-lo)"} Arevalo,
        mononymously known as Homey, and I'm a UI/X designer + developer.
      %p
        Function and aesthetics are my bread and butter for building a personable brand experience. My passion for design stems from a lifelong fascination of creatively solving problems. I'm currently an experience designer and front-end developer at an ad agency, and I serve as Vice President for
        %a{:href => "https://jacksonville.aiga.org/", :target => "_blank"} AIGA Jacksonville,
        a local chapter of the nationâ€™s largest community of design advocates, promoting the value of design.
      %p
        While my focus is on user interactions and the functional experience, I'm a lover of learning and advancing design. Being an interdisciplinary designer has provided a wide lens on how to work with small and large teams and move through projects with high-level analysis of end-to-end user experiences.
