        Since 2008, AIGA Jacksonville, a local chapter of the AIGA professional association of design, has been hosting the "Always Summer Poster Show + Mixtape." Hailed as one of the most anticipated events of the year, Always Summer has been successful in connecting the design community and increasing awareness. Guest speakers, The Bubble Process, were invited to speak, inspire, and experience Always Summer weekend.

      Over 100 posters were submitted and 200 people in attendance to celebrate the Jacksonville creative community along with all the summer jams from past and present. By gathering a holy trinity of photographers, motion designers, and social media experts, the two-day jubilee continues to transfuse event goers with energy, creativity, and new friends.

      The sights and sounds of summer were exquisitely blended with the help of our local DJs who set the tone for the event by playing a mixtape of each poster entry. A sampling of the mixtape can be found on

      Sending out a press release for the event proved to be a benefit in reaching our 36–45 year-old designers. It also introduced Always Summer to a broader audience. The event was featured in the September 2016 edition of Folio Weekly in one of the editor's picks, "Reasons To Leave The House This Week."

      In addition to the gallery event, AIGA Jacksonville invites a guest speaker, who is well-versed in poster design, to lecture and ignite the passion of print. Speakers provide a fresh outlook on the design industry, and tips & tricks on what makes their art unique to their name.
