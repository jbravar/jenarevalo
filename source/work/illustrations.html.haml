        Working on illustrations is a great outlet for creativity, staying sharp, and exploring new mediums. The hands-on process encourages free thinking without limitations. Some of the illustrations are passion projects, and others are customized vector illustrations for events, businesses, and keynotes.

        The hero image above was created for a charitable event. Using wooden blocks to create a puzzle, each surface of the block illustrated a woodland creature.

      A variety of passion projects stem from my love for continued learning. Low-poly illustrations pushed myself to technical precision by connecting geometric shapes and color combinations to create a multi-dimentional image. Adding a touch of animation provides personality to each piece. Other processes include woodburning, painting, and motion graphics.
